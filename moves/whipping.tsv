Torso Lacing	3	A beginner move in the "Body-Lacing" skillset. This move is extremely important and central to all Body-Lacing moves. A basic/smooth wrap around the waist.	It is important to NOT let go of the whip handle; the handle should always stay in your dominant hand.	Make sure you are attentive visually; you may think you are doing the right thing when you aren't.	Once you can do lace by gripping with your fingers, slowly transition to lacing with your WRIST; this will create for smoother/flowier laces.											a	Body-Lacing 
Open Torso Position	1	A specific part of the Torso Lace in which your whip fibers are lined with your back (horizontally) while there are no whip fibers in the front	This position is essential for transitioning into other moves													a	Body-Lacing
Leg Lacing	3	A beginner move in the "Body-Lacing" skillset. Same mechanic and concept as a torso lace but reflected on 1) a leg or 2) both legs	You are essentially taking a body lace and transferring to a leg, your hand movements stay the same or similar! Don't overthink it	Once you have learned your torso and leg lace, practice transitioning to and from both. 												a	Body-Lacing
Cross Leg Lace Transition	3	A beginner transition from one leg to the other. Feels like you are weaving the whip back and forth. 	Remember the concept of the Open Torso Position, the Open Position can be used in any type of lacing move; when you are able to go to Open position, you will be able to move your hands and close on another body part to finish your transition!													a	Body-Lacing

Neck Lace	5	An intermediate move in the "Body-Lacing" skillset. This has a variety of ways to be performed. Essentially a lace around the neck.	To make this move look snazzier, we usually use the elbow lace to transition into the neck lace and raise our elbows again to transition out of this move.													a	Body-Lacing
Super Kick	5	A lace around a bent-knee while kicking out when the time is right to create a mix between a lace and a lash	Repeat the move to see when the timing is good for you! 	Make sure you tuck/bend your knee to the extreme so the whip can wrap well												a	Body-Lacing/Whiplash
Whiplash Twirl	6	Starting with a closed torso lace, whip outwards and then above and then back into a torso lace	Your first whiplash move! This means you are holding onto the handle with one hand while the fibers are flying around you! Be careful and wear protective clothes, this skillset will hurt!													a	Whiplash
2 Beat Whiplash	3	A move integrated from the Poi/Glowsticking arts, directing the whip between the two parallels	Learning a 2 Beat Whiplash is easier for most on the whips compared to glowsticking (because of the increased control), you can indirectly learn how to string through whipping!													a	Whiplash
2 Beat Single-Whip Fountain	6	Essentially combines the 2 Beat Whiplashes smoothly creating a single handed Fountain!	 													a	Whiplash
2 Beat Weave	6	2 Beat Whiplash with 2 whips! Split time! Also derived from Poi/Glowsticking movesets														a	Double-Whip/Whiplash
